Monthly Recap

This past month, five Our Revolution candidates won their primaries, and in Kansas City, the residents voted decisively in support of a $15 per hour bill, in spite of their state legislators' efforts to prevent a rise in the minimum wage. Additionally, local groups lobbied their Representatives to support the #PeoplesPlatform, Senator Bernie Sanders introduced the Medicare for all Act of 2017, Our Revolution launched a new membership package, and the fight for SB 562, which would bring healthcare to all Californians, continues.

** SUMMER FOR PROGRESS
------------------------------------------------------------

Our Revolution and partner organizations called on progressives to fight for the #PeoplesPlatform - eight bills currently in the House of Representatives that will address the concerns of everyday Americans. Groups and members across the country met recently with their Representatives in Congress and delivered a petition with signatures from constituents in each district who support the platform. More than 100 congressional visits and thousands of phone calls later, we moved members of congress on all 8 bills, gaining more than 60 co-sponsors. The fight is just getting started! Expect to hear more about the #PeoplesPlatform in the coming months.

 
** MEDICARE FOR ALL
------------------------------------------------------------

Senator Bernie Sanders introduced the Medicare for all Act of 2017, which already has 16 cosponsors. “Sen. Sanders' Medicare for All bill makes health care a right, not a privilege. Right now, 28 million people do not have health insurance and tens of millions are uninsured,” said Our Revolution President Nina Turner. “Providing safe and accessible healthcare is a moral imperative for our country. Our Revolution will be pushing our members to action, asking their senators to cosponsor and vote for Sen. Sanders’ bill.” Stay tuned on this front! While we can’t promise this will will be the law of the land in 2017, or even before 2021, we must press ahead to grow the movement around Medicare for All.

Inside Our Revolution

Like Bernie Sanders' 2016 Presidential Campaign, Our Revolution runs on a distributed organizing model. This is made possible by volunteers across the country, and the world, working tirelessly for the future they believe in.

The Our Revolution texting team sends out over 100,000 messages each month - recruiting volunteers, getting out the vote for progressive candidates, and informing people across the country of events that are critical to carrying on the movement. With November elections just around the corner, they could use a few more people willing to spread the word of the political revolution from the comfort of their own homes. Interested?
